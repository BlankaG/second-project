# Tip Trip


## User Experience
This website was build for Travelers to either share their Tips from their travels or ask questions to maybe help them to decide to plan their holidays.

This website can build community where people share the same interest, which is Traveling.

The website is divided into few parts, part one where you can use Skyscanner to find the best deals. Second part when you can look for some inspiration for your next holiday, which you can use by the type of holiday etc. Family, Luxury and so on, or you can look for some inspiration by your interests such as Skiing, Hiking or more advantures holidays.

Part three is design to interact with other Travelers to either giv a Tip and upload the photos or Ask a question.

Part four is map, when you can find any amenities, such as restaurants, parks, museums and other.

The last part is when you can subscribe for any special deals and offers.

Wireframes are to be found in Gitpod under README.md


## Design, Images, Color scheme

The whole side has blue and white contrast to enhance the holiday feel. I have chossen the background picture with the blue hat, which I think is very eye-catching and will get people who visit the website interested in quickly to scroll through out the content.

In section 'What is Popular' and 'Get Active', I have used cards with images which are relevant to the topics. The cards are nice way to present the idea of how to look for holidays based on certain interest. You can either click on the card itself or on the small square in the bottom, or the image. Etheir way it works so it will open new page with some ideas of the travels.

The section 'Travelers to Travelers' and footer which includes Social Links and 'Subscribe for deals' is styled with nice contrast of blue and yelow.

## Features


The website is working on all devices, on the main computer desk view all the cards are presented in line of four, on smaller devices in line of two and the smallest screens would have each card in one line.

The website has interactive elements:

- Skyscanner widget implemented for searching the best deals
- Css cards which are related to some holiday topics and when clicked on another page will load with some ideas
- From Travelers to Travelers section has two pop-up windows to either 'Give a Tip' or 'Ask a question'.
- The map to look for some amenities
- Subscribe for deals
